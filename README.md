A simple python project using the pretrained FasterRCNN for object detection

# Object Detection with PyTorch

This project implements an object detection model using PyTorch. The model is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture and utilizes a pre-trained model to detect objects in images.

## Features
- Loads images and performs object detection.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected objects and saves the output images.
- Utilizes a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from the PyTorch library.
